# MACD-Strategy-with-Additional-Indicators
Overview
The AlphaTrend Momentum Trader is a proprietary trading strategy developed to capture momentum-based trading opportunities in financial markets. The strategy combines the signals generated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator with additional indicators such as a moving average (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and On-Balance Volume (OBV) to confirm trade entries.

Strategy Components
1. MACD Settings
Fast EMA Length: Defines the length of the fast exponential moving average (EMA) used in the MACD calculation.
Slow EMA Length: Defines the length of the slow exponential moving average (EMA) used in the MACD calculation.
Signal Line Length: Defines the length of the signal line (also an EMA) used in the MACD calculation.
2. Moving Average (Trend Indicator)
Moving Average Period: Specifies the period for calculating the moving average (MA) to identify the primary trend direction.
3. Relative Strength Index (Momentum Indicator)
RSI Period: Determines the period for calculating the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the strength of price movements and helps identify overbought and oversold conditions.
4. On-Balance Volume (Volume Indicator)
Calculation Method: On-Balance Volume (OBV) is calculated manually based on volume flow and price movements to confirm the strength of price movements.
